This is my assignment submission for an assignment during my second year of my degree. It was about assembly language programming using the MIPS simulator called SPIM. There were three problems we needed to solve:
	1. Write a program to determine if an integer is a palindrome or not
	2. Write a program to determine if an integer is prime or not
	3. Write a program to find all the palindromic primes between two integers supplied as inputs
